#### :hourglass: Pomodoro-Timer
:octocat: Timer based on the Pomodoro technique. Created using HTML, CSS and jQuery.
***
The idea for this project came from FreeCodeCamp, where the project is one of a total of 9 front-end development related projects. My Pomodoro Timer is responsive and has a different color scheme that fits well without being too disturbing or attracting much attention, which is good for having good productive sessions.

##### With this project, I learned to...   
– Control the order of appearance for all three main elements: break block, work block, and the circle timer itself.   
– Play a sound to alert the user when the session is over.   
– Add words after HTML elements with jQuery when they meet a certain set of rules.  
– Use functions to determine the various states of the pomodoro timer.  

##### Known bugs  
– Timer always counts one more minute than it should. *(Fixed!)*      
– Not enough space on the setter boxes when big numbers are reached (80, 90, 99+ and so on). *(Fixed!)*   
– Current audio sound is giving a `404 not found` error and needs to be changed. *(To do!)*   

##### Todos
– Refactor JavaScript code.   
– Refactor CSS styles.
